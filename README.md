# Overview
Simple app written in C# VS 2013 to specifically showcase that both `AerospikeClient.dll` built for **x86 (32-bit)** target and external application referencing the `.dll` can successfully run aggregations on top of the Aerospike DB. 

## Build Aerospike C# Client for **x86 (32-bit)**

- Download it from [here](http://www.aerospike.com/download/client/csharp/3.0.12/)
- Extract the contents on your local machine
- Open **AerospikeClient/AerospikeClient.csproj** in Visual Studio 2013
- Change the following settings via `Project` > `AerospikeClient Properties`
    + Configuration: **Active (Release)**
    + Platform: **Active (x86)** 
    + Platform target: **x86**
- Run `Build` > `Build Solution` &mdash; this should generate `AerospikeClient.dll` in `<local-client-download-folder>\bin\x86\Release` folder

**Keep note of** `AerospikeClient.dll` in `<local-client-download-folder>\bin\x86\Release` folder.

# Aggregation In Action 

Follow these steps to run this application and see [aggregation](/ASConsoleApp/udf/aggregationByRegion.lua) running against x86 (32-bit) target.

## Prerequisites

- [Aerospike Server](http://www.aerospike.com/download/server/latest) â€“ It should be running and accessible from this app
- Visual Studio 2013

## Build

- Download, clone or fork this repo -- basicially get the code one way or another :)
- Open **ASConsoleApp.sln** in VS 2013
- Add reference to generated `AerospikeClient.dll` located in `<local-client-download-folder>\bin\x86\Release` folder via `Project` > `Add Reference...` (**NOTE:** Be sure to first remove any existing refrences to `AerospikeClient.dll`)
- In [**Program.cs**](/ASConsoleApp/Program.cs), update ***asServerIP*** and ***asServerPort*** such that it points to your instance running the Aerospike Server
- `Build` and `Start` the application

If all goes well, you should see message **"INFO: Connection to Aerospike cluster succeeded!"** along with a menu of options in the console. See Usage.

## Usage

- First menu option &mdash; selecting (1) will:
  - Create 10,000 dummy user records with randomly selected ***region*** ('n', 'e', 'w', 's') and a ***tweetcount*** of up to 20. NOTE: You should definitely do this the first time you run the app.
- Second menu option &mdash; selecting (2) will:
  - Ask you to input ***tweetcount*** range (*min* and *max*)
  - Create `Secondary Index` on ***tweetcount*** 
  - Register `Streaming UDF` [`aggregationByRegion`](/ASConsoleApp/udf/aggregationByRegion.lua)
  - Execute range query on ***tweetcount*** based on *min* and *max* entered
  - Run aggregation on the range query resultset 
  - Output aggregation result to the console
  
## Takeaway

Anything is possible :)
